1. make sure that Node.js LTS version installed - https://nodejs.org/en/
and node -v or npm -v works fine
2. run `npm install` to download all required packages
3. start project with `npm run start` command

better to run compilation to find erros faster

some scripts with description
`npm start` - run webpack-dev server with watch mode (auto-reload after changes)
`npm run build` - for fast dev compilation
`npm run build:aot` - long compilation, for prod
